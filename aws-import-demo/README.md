Step 1: Configure Your Terraform Workspace
Ensure your Terraform Cloud workspace (aws-import) is configured with the correct version control system (VCS) integration and contains the Terraform configuration for managing your AWS resources.

Example Terraform Code (main.tf):

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  # Arguments will be populated after import
}
Commit this code to the repository linked with your Terraform Cloud workspace.

Step 2: Identify the EC2 Instance to Import
Find the ID of the EC2 instance you want to import. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI:

aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=YourInstanceName"
The InstanceId will look like i-0abcdef1234567890.

Step 3: Terraform Import Command
Terraform Cloud does not allow direct execution of CLI commands like terraform import. To import the resource, you'll need to use a local copy of Terraform CLI connected to the same backend.

Clone the repository linked to your aws-import workspace:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Log in to Terraform Cloud using the CLI:

terraform login
Initialize the Terraform configuration to sync with Terraform Cloud:

terraform init
Import the EC2 instance into the state:


terraform import aws_instance.my_instance i-0abcdef1234567890
Check the state to confirm the resource is imported:


terraform state list
Step 4: Update Terraform Configuration
After importing, Terraform will recognize the resource in the state, but your configuration (main.tf) will not yet include the resource's actual attributes. To align the configuration with the imported resource:

Generate a plan to see the differences:


terraform plan
Manually update the aws_instance block in your main.tf file with the attributes from the imported resource. Alternatively, use the terraform show command to get the current state of the resource.

Step 5: Push Changes to VCS
Once the configuration is updated:

Add and commit the updated configuration to your Git repository:


git add .
git commit -m "Import existing EC2 instance into Terraform"
git push
Terraform Cloud will detect the changes via the VCS integration and trigger a run.

Step 6: Verify in Terraform Cloud
Go to the Terraform Cloud UI for the aws-import workspace.
Review the plan generated by the VCS-triggered run to ensure everything is as expected.
Apply the plan to finalize the import process.
Summary
Prepare Terraform configuration in your VCS repository.
Use terraform import locally with the same backend as Terraform Cloud.
Update the configuration (main.tf) with the imported resource's attributes.
Commit and push changes to the VCS repository.
Verify and apply the changes in Terraform Cloud.
